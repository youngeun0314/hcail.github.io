abstract={We report on a study of how older adult viewers use YouTube. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 older adults residing in the Republic of Korea who had recently watched videos on YouTube to understand their experiences. We identified themes regarding their perceptions and behaviors when interacting with videos and other viewers on YouTube through an open coding method. The analysis of the identified themes reveals that older adults use YouTube as a tool for collecting information that addresses their challenges when gathering information from media. Although older adult viewers worried about fake news and possible monetary charges, they were eager to watch videos on YouTube because they believed this information to be unbiased compared with media sources. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first interview study to investigate the community of older adult viewers on a video-based social media platform.},

  author={Lee, Hyunmin and Jung, Hyunggu},
  journal={Proceedings of Korea Computer Congress},
    year={2022},
  month={June},
  abstract={Due to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and social
  distancing, the food delivery application market has  shown
  rapid  growth.  This  made  customer  reviews  on  restaurants
  of  delivery  applications  influencing. However, fake reviews
  are being written to mislead customers with false information.
  Typically, review events held  by  restaurants  encourage  customers
  to  leave  positive  reviews  on  the  delivery  applications,
  making  it difficult  for  users  to  write  objective  and  honest  reviews.
  We  try  to  solve  this  problem  by  creating  a  tool
  that labels restaurant notices promoting such review events.
  We first collected and preprocessed restaurant notice data and
  used the data to train and evaluate a classifier model.},

  abstract={A  deep  learning  method  has  been  widely  used  in  various
  fields  for  many  years.  However,  due  to  the characteristic  of the
  deep  learning  method,  it  is  difficult for decision-makers  to  trust
  the  results inferred  from the  deep  learning  model.  To  support  model
  developers  in  improving  their  models,  we  developed  a  visual analytics
  tool  that  allows  users  to  review  the  recall,  precision,  and  images
  of  each  class  by  displaying  the images  on  a  coordinate  plane.
  The  tool  allows  model  developers
  to  understand  the  training  results
  by supporting them in interpreting the characteristics of the dataset used to train the model.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has been widely used to assist
  art therapists with artwork assessments by providing objective information.
  While prior studies showed that AI-assisted tools are feasible to improve
  drawing analysis in in-person art therapy practices, the use of those tools
  in online art therapy is still under-examined. To fill the gap, we created
  a prototype of an AI-assisted tool for online therapy in a House-Tree-Person
  (HTP) test scenario and ran lab-based usability sessions with 10 art therapists
  in which they used our proposed prototype to complete predefined tasks.
  We then conducted semi-structured interviews with the participants
  to understand their acceptance and concerns about the prototype.
  The findings revealed the unique needs of art therapists and opportunities
  of using AI-assisted tools to improve online art therapy practices.
  Based on these findings, we suggest implications for creating AI-assisted
  tools that meet specific needs of art therapists in online therapy sessions,
  and further discuss future directions of research about AI-assisted tools
  for art therapists in online settings.},

in Virtual Reality Environments with a Subway Fire Disaster Scenario},
journal={Universal Access in the Information Society},

abstract={Training to cope with fire disaster situations utilizing virtual reality (VR) environments as educational materials is becoming universalized. It is widely accepted that VR enables young adult trainees to undergo tactical training in potential disaster situations. However, little is known whether older adults are satisfied with using such a technique for disaster response training. To address this insufficiency, we created a VR environment in a subway fire disaster scenario and conducted an experiment, wherein 13 young and 9 older adults were asked to explore the VR environment. We then conducted surveys and semi-structured interviews involving the participants to understand their experiences. The analysis of results revealed that compared to young adults, older adults tended to move greater distances, take longer times, felt less afraid and scared, and experienced less difficulty in manipulating the controller. Subsequently, we suggest design opportunities for creating VR environments for more effective training of older adults.},
